			<h1>Objective</h1>
			<p>The Computer-world magazine reports in an article about the NoSQL meet-up in San Francisco that
				"NoSQLers came to share how they had overthrown the tyranny of slow, expensive relational databases in
				favor of more efficient and cheaper ways of managing data.". It states that especially Web
				2.0 startups have begun their business without Oracle and even without MySQL which formerly was popular
				among startups. Instead, they built their own data-stores influenced by Amazon’s Dynamo and
				Google’s Bigtable in order to store and process huge amounts of data like they appear e.g.
				in social community or cloud computing applications; meanwhile, most of these data-stores became open
				source software. For example, Cassandra originally developed for a new search feature by Facebook is now
				part of the Apache Software Project. According to engineer Avinash Lakshman, it is able to write 2500
				times faster into a 50 gigabytes large database than MySQL (from Christof Strauch @Lecture Notes)</p>
